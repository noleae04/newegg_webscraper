# newegg_webscraper
Very basic web scraper that parses through information from newegg graphics cards (one page as of now)

# Functionality

All you have to do is run the program with Python 3 and it will produce a .csv file that you can open in a spreadsheet processor (or not, idk what you'll do with it then but that's not of my business)

# Bugs/Things I'm not going to fix for now

This program lacks iteration through every page in newegg graphics card pages, some criteria not being parsed properly, and this one odd issue that creates a new column whenever there's a 'space', so to fix that I just made every 'space' into a pipe, see if you can tolerate that, if you can't just replace every '|' with a 'space'

# I made this like in two days lol
