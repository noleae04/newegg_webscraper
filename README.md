# Newegg Web Scraper
Web scraper that parses through information from newegg graphics cards

# Functionality

Run the program with Python 3 and it will produce a .csv file that you can open in a spreadsheet processor (e.g. Excel, Openoffice Calc)

# Bugs

This program lacks iteration through every page in newegg graphics card pages, some criteria not being parsed properly, and this one odd issue that creates a new column whenever there's a 'space', so to fix that I just made every 'space' into a pipe, to fix this, replace every '|' with a 'space'
